# image-auto-orientation
Machine learning application to find correct orientation of images

data-generation/generate-images.py
	
	Edit the file to specify path to your image folder. This script works on a folder organized as follows:

		my-images 
			|-- class-1-images
			|-- class-2-images
			|-- ...
			|-- class-n-images

	It takes all the images for each class and generates their rotation at 90, 180 and 270 degrees.
	This rotated images and the original one are saved in the destination path (edit file to specify) in the following way:

		rot-images
			|-- class-1-images_0
			|-- class-1-images_90
			|-- class-1-images_180
			|-- class-1-images_270
			|-- class-2-images_0
			|-- class-2-images_90
			|-- ...
			|-- class-n-images_270

data-generation/generate-dataset.py
	
	Works on the directory generated by data-generation.py. Edit file to specify path. 
	tensorflow utils are used to generate batches of dataset. batch[0] of shape (k, w, h, c). k is the batch size, h and w is image size and c is the number of channel (rgb=3). batch[1] of shape (k,) contains the labels associated with the images in batch[0]. for example image batch[0][0] has label batch[1][0].
